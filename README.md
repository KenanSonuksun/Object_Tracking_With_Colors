# Object_Tracking_With_Colors
<br><br>
 The project is about Image Processing.
 <br><br>
The project has been done with Python. The main idea is how to track objects with their colours. Some areas from the image are divided by their color values. 
With these values, the code can find the object it wanted to track  easily.
